# LITA Forum Attendees Map
  
A map of where LITA Forum attendees were from using [d3](http://d3js.org/). Uses [an SVG map of the US and Canada from Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BlankMap-USA-states-Canada-provinces,_HI_closer.svg) by user [Lokal_Profil](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Lokal_Profil), [CC-BY-SA-2.5](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/). Loads 2014 data by default; edit the `d3.json('data/2014.json', handleJSON);` line of main.js to map data from 2013.

## Getting started

- git clone this repo
- `bower install` inside its root to get d3, requires [Bower](http://bower.io/) & thus [Node](http://nodejs.org)

You could map any data set as long as you have a JSON file of [ISO 3166 state/province abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2) paired with numeric data. The JSON looks like:

```js
{
    "US-AK": 12,
    "CA-YT": 500000
}
```

## Exporting the Map to an Image

While there are a few steps, it's easy to export the map to an image file:

- Open up the map in a web browser.
- Using the browser's JavaScript console, copy the outerHTML of the SVG map to your system clipboard. In Chrome and Safari, this is as simple as running `copy($('#map').outerHTML)`.
- Save this text to a file ending in ".svg". You will probably want to increase the SVG canvas size so your exported image is higher resolution; change the "width" and "height" attributes of the `<svg>` element to something higher like 1730.
- Use [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org) to convert the SVG to an image, e.g. by running `convert map.svg map.png` in the same directory as the SVG file.
